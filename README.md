This application is meant to be an online version to track your HP in the table top game Marvel Champions.
It is replacing the physical dial and eventually will be able to do scheme management as well. 

This was meant to help with the table clutter and space that might limit in some cases. 4 players matches take up the most space while 1 player takes up the least.

To run the program download the Code and download MAMP or XAMP folder. Once done put all of the downloaded files into the HDOCS folder under MAMP or XAMP. Go and Run XAMP or MAMP and pick CAPSTONE from there you can use the code. 

This application is not hosted on a server yet it can be used on your LocalHost as of right now.

Thank You for testing and using the Web Application
